        A look into the data regarding concussions, from the focus on athletes to
        the data driven concern regarding both the general population and military. A deep
        dive into the CDC (Center for Disease Control) reporting along with a raw JSON
        dataset from the Veterans Affairs Agency.  While we show some limited python functionality, the
        data is converted and parsed then charted to help tell a story.
