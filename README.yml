        This paper deals with the challenge Big Data/Data Science has
        with mobility network traffic in relationship to forecasting
        network demands.  At a high level will look at traffic types,
        varience in the data types and the potential that exist
        leveraging and aligning all this big data to truly tell us
        something meaningful.

        A look into the data regarding concussions, from the focus on
        athletes to the data driven concern regarding both the general
        population and military. A deep dive into the CDC (Center for
        Disease Control) reporting along with a raw JSON dataset from
        the Veterans Affairs Agency.  While we show some limited
        python functionality, the data is converted and parsed then
        charted to help tell a story.  note 1 on project - the bulk of
        the data analysis started with JSON data converted to CSV and
        then parsing, charting, etc.  graph2 in github is a snippet of
        the JSON data.  The entire dataset is available at the website
        (that I included in the .bib).  Also, I could not get the
        image to adjust properly.  note 2 on project - The converted
        JSON files to CSV are included in github.  I have all charts
        available in excel as I was not able to do this in Python.  I
        can include any of that if needed.  note 3 on project - In the
        project images folder are 7 charts.png files.  chart1 &
        chart2.png came from the CDC and Veteran Affairs websites and
        charts3-7 I created.  This was referenced in the .txt but want
        to include it here.  If you want to see any of this I can
        provide any graph. I figured a .png would be sufficient.  note
        on python- I included the jupyter notebook from my work but
        didn't name it as "appendix", though that's my intent.  Please
        note that I have never used Python and had a variety of issues
        geting it loaded.  For example, my computer indicated that the
        panda libray was loaded, but I could never get it to import
        panda to use which I had intended to use to parse the data.  I
        include the notebook to show 1) I was not able to leverage
        that library and that 2) I was at least able to pull the .csv
        file into the notebook but I am not experienced enough to
        parse it and chart the results so I used what I knew, which is
        excel.
